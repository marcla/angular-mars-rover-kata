# Angular Mars Rover Kata

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.3.

You’re part of the team that explores Mars by sending remotely controlled vehicles to the surface of the planet.
Develop an API that translates the commands sent from earth to instructions that are understood by the rover.

## Requirements

* You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
* The rover receives a character array of commands.
* Implement commands that move the rover forward/backward (f,b).
* Implement commands that turn the rover left/right (l,r).
* Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another. (planets are spheres after all)
* Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point, aborts the sequence and reports the obstacle.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
